<h2>Message from the IEEE eScience 2022 Organization</h2>

<p>We understand the concerns you may have to attend a conference in person.</p>

<p>Because of state regulations, we cannot enforce vaccinations at the conference. Still we strongly encourage all our attendees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, follow the CDC guidance, and to properly wear (covering nose, mouth and chin) a high-quality KN-95 or N-95 face mask while at  the conference. eScience will have a supply of KN-95 masks available to attendees during the conference and will have a limited number of tests for attendees.</p>

<p>We have selected a venue that will be fully dedicated to the conference attendees limiting the exposure to people who are not attendees. We are working with the venue to make sure there is proper ventilation, hand sanitizers, and social distancing.</p>
