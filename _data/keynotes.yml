    Although Digital Twins have been used since the early 2000’s for Product Lifecycle Management purposes, 
    it is only recently that this concept has gained momentum in the Earth Science domain. It has the 
    potential to revolutionize the way Earth Science research will be conducted in the future, and how 
    results and knowledge from this research will provide information to support decision making and yield 
    impactful societal benefits.
    
    <br><br>
    We define an <b><i>Earth System Digital Twin (or ESDT)</i></b> as an Information System for Understanding, 
    Forecasting, and Conjecturing the complex interconnections among Earth systems, including 
    anthropomorphic forcings and impacts to humanity. 
    
    <br><br>
    More specifically, an Earth System Digital Twin is a dynamic and interactive information system that 
    first provides a digital replica of the past and current states of the Earth or Earth system, as 
    accurately and timely as possible (i.e., the <b>“What Now”</b>); second allows for computing forecasts of 
    future states under nominal assumptions and based on the current replica (i.e., the <b>“What Next”</b>); 
    and third offers the capability to investigate many hypothetical scenarios under varying impact 
    assumptions (i.e., the <b>“What If”</b>). The full power of digital twins is that, through an integrated 
    representation and standardized tools and software technologies, the same digital replica can address 
    the needs of multiple users at various resolutions (spatial and temporal) and for various applications 
    (science, economic, policy, etc.) – “from farmer to scientist”. 
    
    <br><br>
    The challenges of building optimal digital twins are many and complex. In 2020, to study these 
    challenges and to develop the technologies needed to build them, NASA’s Advanced Information Systems 
    Technology (AIST) Program has started a new thrust in Earth System Digital Twins (ESDTs), 
    investigating the benefits of ESDT for NASA Earth Science, studying specific use cases and developing 
    technologies and components as well as a few prototype systems that will help identify building blocks 
    from which future ESDTs will be built. All these various aspects describing NASA ESDT efforts will be 
    presented during the talk.

    Jacqueline Le Moigne is Manager of NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Earth Science Technology 
    Office’s (ESTO) Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) Program. The AIST Program focuses on 
    information and software systems as well as novel computer science technologies that enable future 
    Earth Science observations and missions.

    <br><br>
    Prior to managing AIST, Jacqueline was the Assistant Chief for Technology in the Software Division at 
    NASA Goddard. She was also involved with the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Space 
    Technology Research Grants Program and with the development of NASA Space Technology Roadmaps. 
    Before joining NASA, she was a Research Scientist with the Computer Vision Laboratory of the 
    University of Maryland. She has also worked in the private sector.

    <br><br>
    Jacqueline received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, 
    France. Her research interests include Image Registration, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, 
    Autonomous Systems, Distributed Spacecraft Missions (DSM), and Earth System Digital Twins (ESDT), as 
    well as high-performance and onboard computing.

    <br><br>
    Jacqueline has over 180 publications including more than 30 journal papers and book chapters. She 
    authored an edited book and earned three Patents, all in the area of Image Registration. She has 
    been an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology Program Evaluator, a member of the Advisory 
    Panel of the NATO Committee on Science for Peace and Security, an Associate Editor for the IEEE 
    Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, and a Goddard Senior Fellow. She received a NASA 
    Exceptional Service Medal as well as of the Goddard Information Science and Technology Award, both 
    in 2012.
