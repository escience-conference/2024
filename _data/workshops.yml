# - name: '3rd Workshop on Reproducible Workflows, Data Management, and Security (ReWorDS 2023)'
#   abstract: >
#             Emerging and future computational workloads are combining traditional HPC applications with tools and techniques from the scale-out data analytics and machine learning community. Getting these technologies to co-exist and interoperate to advance scientific discovery is a daunting task with few known good solutions. In general, constructing these workflows has the potential to create pitfalls and incompatibilities that limit adoption.

#             This workshop seeks to explore ideas and experiences on what kinds of infrastructure developments can improve upon the state of the art. Explorations of component packaging via containers and virtual machines, automation scripting, deployment,  portability builds, and system support for these and other relevant activities are key infrastructure.
