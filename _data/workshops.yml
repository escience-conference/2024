# - name: '3rd Workshop on Reproducible Workflows, Data Management, and Security (ReWorDS 2023)'
#   abstract: >
#             Emerging and future computational workloads are combining traditional HPC applications with tools and techniques from the scale-out data analytics and machine learning community. Getting these technologies to co-exist and interoperate to advance scientific discovery is a daunting task with few known good solutions. In general, constructing these workflows has the potential to create pitfalls and incompatibilities that limit adoption.

#             This workshop seeks to explore ideas and experiences on what kinds of infrastructure developments can improve upon the state of the art. Explorations of component packaging via containers and virtual machines, automation scripting, deployment,  portability builds, and system support for these and other relevant activities are key infrastructure.

    The 5GRP workshop is organized by the Global Research Platform community and co-located with
    eScience. This workshop focuses on recent and emerging advances in networking architectures,
    services, technologies, and infrastructures, and how these innovations can directly support
    global science research and applications. 5GRP is an open event and eScience registrants are
    welcome to attend.
