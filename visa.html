<h4>Important note for travelers</h4>
<p>
    Residents of non-EU countries who hold valid multiple-entry Schengen visas must first pass through a full Schengen
    member territory in order to utilize the visa in Cyprus. The Schengen Visa holder is allowed to travel to Cyprus
    directly from a Schengen member country without applying for a National Cypriot visa and stay in the Republic of
    Cyprus for the duration of their Schengen visa.
</p>
<p>
    The above arrangements <strong>do not</strong> apply for persons holding a Turkish or Azerbaijani passport. If you
    are affected, please visit the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2016.nsf/mfa81_en/mfa81_en?OpenDocument"
