eScience warmly invites proposals for workshops. Workshops offer a platform for valuable discussions among researchers and practitioners, focusing on key topics and emerging research areas in the field of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and distributed computing. Workshops typically feature a blend of invited talks, peer-reviewed papers, panel discussions, and work-in-progress presentations. Workshop organizers are encouraged to structure their sessions for an audience of approximately 20-40 participants, with flexibility for either a full day or half day format depending on interest and space availability.
 
We welcome proposals for workshops on new, innovative topics as well as submissions to continue successful workshops from previous years. Note that proceedings of eScience workshops will be published by the IEEE in dedicated proceedings. The selected workshops will be held on the first two days of the conference (16-17 September).
