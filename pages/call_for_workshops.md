The 19th IEEE eScience Conference will be held in **Limassol, Cyprus on October 9-13, 2023**. eScience 2023 welcomes proposals for workshops to be co-located with the main conference on **Monday, October 9 and Tuesday, October 10, 2023**.

The eScience conference has a long history of hosting well-attended workshops broadly related to eScience and co-located with the main conference. These workshops share the goal of bringing together international and interdisciplinary research communities, developers, and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies.

Workshops play a crucial role in the conference by providing an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their work in a more focused way than the conference itself and to have in-depth discussions of particular topics of interest to the community. Workshops may be focused on any eScience-related topic including, but not limited to, interdisciplinary and translational research, continuum computing infrastructures, data science, sustainability, and education.

eScience 2023 invites authors of workshop proposals to consider a diverse group of organizers, paper reviewers, and keynote speakers in terms of race/ethnicity, gender, and geographic areas.

eScience 2023 accepts two types of workshop proposals: 
1. workshops with peer-reviewed papers and proceedings, and 
2. workshops or mini-symposia with invited talks and no proceedings.

All eScience 2023 workshops are expected to have a half-day duration.

### Workshops with peer-reviewed papers and proceedings

The proceedings of workshops with peer-reviewed papers will be included in the eScience 2023 proceedings to be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, USA and made available online through the IEEE Digital Library, if the following criteria are followed:

- The solicitation for papers must be open.
- All the papers must be peer-reviewed by a qualified Program Committee.
- The workshops Program Committee must have an appropriate size for the expected number of submissions.
- The workshop proceedings must have at least 4 papers at a length of at least 6 pages and no longer than 10 pages (including figure, tables, and citations) in the IEEE conference format.
- For each paper selected for publication, at least one of the authors must be registered to eScience 2023 to present the paper in person.

Workshop organizers are responsible for establishing a program committee and a paper submission system, collecting and evaluating submissions, notifying authors of acceptance or rejection in due time, ensuring a transparent and fair selection process, organizing selected papers into sessions, and assigning session chairs. Proposals showing clear focus and objectives in areas of emerging or developing interest will be prioritized.

Workshop proposals should be submitted via email to [workshops@escience-conference.org](mailto:workshops@escience-conference.org) and not exceed 5 pages in length. 

Proposals should include the following information:

- Workshop name and acronym.
- Workshop description, including its focus and goals (max. 500 words).
- Names and affiliations of the organizers and tentative composition of the committee (we invite the authors of the proposal to consider a diverse group of organizers and committee members in terms of e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, geographic areas, etc.).
- Expected number of submissions/accepted papers.
- Prior history of this workshop, if any.

### Workshops or mini-symposia with invited talks and no proceedings

Workshop organizers are responsible for inviting the speakers, establishing a program in due time, organizing the selected talks into sessions, and assigning session chairs. Proposals gathering experts in areas of emerging or developing interest will be prioritized.

Each speaker must be registered to eScience 2023 to present in a session.

Workshop proposals should be submitted via email to [workshops@escience-conference.org](mailto:workshops@escience-conference.org) and not exceed 5 pages in length. 

Proposals for workshops or mini-symposia with invited talks only should include the following information:
