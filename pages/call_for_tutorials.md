## Conference Call for Tutorials

The 20th IEEE eScience Conference will be held in Osaka, Japan on September 16-20, 2024. eScience 2024 welcomes proposals for tutorials to be held with the main conference.

The eScience 2024 Tutorial Program is intended to teach new and/or state-of-the art tools and techniques relevant to the eScience audience, disseminate information to conference attendees on recently emerging topics and trends, or provide surveys and overviews of related digital technologies.

We encourage all submissions that fall in the area of the conference, and particularly those that have a practical (hands-on) component that helps attendees learn new technologies in eScience. We also encourage submissions that disseminate new technologies in eScience to a more diverse audience.
