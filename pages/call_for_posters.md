The 18th IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience 2022), to be held in Salt Lake City on October 11-14, 2022, welcomes poster submissions for the technical program.

eScience 2022 provides an interdisciplinary forum for researchers, developers, and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies. Its objective is to promote and encourage all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms, and tools, with a strong focus on practical solutions and open challenges. The conference welcomes conceptualization, implementation, and experience contributions enabling and driving innovation in data- and compute-intensive research across all disciplines, from the physical and biological sciences to the social sciences, arts, and humanities; encompassing artificial intelligence and machine learning methods; and targeting a broad spectrum of architectures, including HPC, cloud, and IoT.

The overarching theme of eScience 2022 conference is "Democratizing eScience". This year, the conference is emphasizing three key topics:

- Translational Research in Computer and Computational Sciences
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Science
- Data and Data Democratization

The conference is soliciting poster submissions (**2 pages, IEEE format**) showcasing early-stage results and innovations.

All submissions will be single-blind peer reviewed. Accepted posters will be presented during a poster reception. Accepted poster papers will be published in the conference proceedings through the IEEE Digital Library. Shortened versions of rejected full papers can be re-submitted for a poster presentation. At least one author of each accepted poster must register as an author at the full registration rate. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission.
